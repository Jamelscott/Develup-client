# DevelUp

A fullstack application that allows users to create flash cards and organize them by categories. Inside each category will have a list of decks. For example, inside a Web Developer catergory there might be a deck for React and Node.
Inside each deck will have a series of cards that contain questions of varying difficulties. A user can submit their answers to the questions and then the actual answer will be revealed. A user can utilize the app to see what topics they understand and what topics they need to improve on.
It's time to DevelUp!
